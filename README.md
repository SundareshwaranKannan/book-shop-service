# book-shop-service
The book-shop-service is a spring boot java application. The project is used to perform all the basic backend operations involved in a book bank. I implemented this project for walking through the basics of Restful API and micro-services using spring boot framework.

The fortend code for the project using Vue.js is available in my other repo:
